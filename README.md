Print_Fibonacci_Util_Overflow

This program calculates the signed Fibonacci number sequence, stopping only when the number is over the signed DWORD range. Don't let your loop counter be 46 or any others, since you are not supposed to know in advance. The program displays each decimal integer value on a separate line, prefixed with a index as follows:
1: 1
2: 1
3: 2
4: 3
5: 5
6: 8

In this exercise, you should be able use four registers enough without memory
Further thinking: What's coding difference, if the Fibonacci numbers are considered as unsigned?
